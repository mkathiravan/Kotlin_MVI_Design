# Kotlin_MVI_Hilt

Hilt defines a standard way to do dependency injection (DI) in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically for you. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger so benefits from the compile time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides.
